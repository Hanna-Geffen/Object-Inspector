<h1 align="center">Object-Inspector</h1>
<h3 align="center">Implemented a recursive Object Inspector using Reflection APIs to navigate nested objects and call the Object Visitor which prints the contents of objects and their fields. </h3>
<p>
This code contains a C# implementation of an object inspector which can be used to traverse and print the contents of objects and their fields. It includes an interface called ObjectVisitor, a ConsoleObjectPrinter class that implements that interface to print the output to the console, and an ObjectInspector class which performs the traversal and calls the appropriate ObjectVisitor methods. The code also includes some example classes and a test suite to demonstrate the functionality of the ObjectInspector.
